Push swap:

~ Mandatory :

----------------------------------
- Program name :
	push_swap
- File to send :
	Makefile, *.h, *.c
- Makefile :
	NAME, all, clean, fclean, re
- Arguments :
	pile a -> a list of int
- Allowed function :
	read, write, malloc, free, exit, all libft and function we code
----------------------------------

- All the standard input are going into the a pile (The first param is at the top at the pile).
- Take account that the arg can be a string that contain number:
	example : "1 34 27 12 76 42"
So need to convert it to multiple string to use it after.
- There is two pile : a & b 
	pile a : contain the standard input and the sorted list at the end.
	pile b : this pile is use to do operation to sort the list.
- We need to check if all the argument are correct,
an argument is incorrect if:
	the argument is not a number
	the argument do an int overflow/underflow
	the argument is duplicate
- Step to check if arguments are correct:
	split all the argument, and store them in a char **
	check that there is only digit and sign in the arguments
	convert every string to int
	check if there is duplication
if there is an error in one of this steps, write Error\n in standard error (stderr: 2)
